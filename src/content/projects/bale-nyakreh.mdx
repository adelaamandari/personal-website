## Cultural Concept

1. **Tri Angga** is an order in which the cultural and religious belief become the base concept in spatial arrengement with three levels of value. The Balinese expressed them as **utama, madya,** and **nista** (top, middle, and bottom). In human being, Tri Angga would be represented by the **head, body,** and **legs** .

2. The design was developed by involving **local communities** as the main focus of the project, so that it could encourage social interaction, while also providing employment that could impact economy growth through the building process.

3. The **"Connecting People"** concept was developed by creating a **wood deck** that bounds up to three rooms together to create a small social space in between. To encourage greater interaction, a **fireplace** is placed among a larger cluster of the villas, which can be used as a gathering place to relax, socialize, or enjoy the panoramic view of the Mandalika Beach. Every cluster is also connected through a **restaurant** in the center.

## Utility system

1. **Water gutters** are installed on the rooftop to uphold **tropical architecture** concept. From the roof, the rainwater will be flowed into the gutter pipe on the perimeter with the help of the solar panel slope, which then will be collected into the rainwater storage tank. **Solar Panel** is also installed as a water heater and to provide backup electricity.

2. **Natural airflow** is made possible by designing ventilation at the top and bottom part of the wall to create **cross ventilation** effect. Energy saving is also done through **skylight** installation on the roof to absolve the need of artificial light during the day.
