**Bale Nyakreh**, is a glamping villa located in the special economic zone of the hill area of Mandalika, West Nusa Tenggara. This glamping villa is designed to provide a pleasant temporary living area for the tourist who will explore Lombok and watch MotoGP in Mandalika Circuit. The design of Bale Nyakreh consist of three main concepts, which are the practice of Tri Angga in the building form, connecting people seen in the space arrangement, and through prefab design and the usage of local materials.

## Building Issues

In 2021, Indonesia planned to host the prestigious motorcycle race MotoGP for the first time. This world-class motor racing event will be held on a new circuit in the Mandalika Special Economic Zone in the island of Lombok in West Nusa Tenggara. Currently, Lombok lacks enough places for tourist to stay. Over 60,000 more hotel rooms are estimted by the government to be needed for this event. However, community members can build prefab glamping areas around remote villages using locally available materials.

## Site Analysis

This glamping site is located in the Mandalika Special Economic Zone (KEK). The land is located in the cliff, especially Zone F1, called The Hill Tops. The site area is about 5 hectares which will be developed into one of the glamping sites which consist of 60 cottages and are divided into 5 groups. The site is located on hill top 40 meters above sea level. The average temperature of the site is 21-32 degree Celcius and average humidity is 81%. The site is located 5km from the MotoGP center. Other nearby attractions are King Beach, Aan Beach, Hidden Beach, and Merese Hill.

## Site Plan

The center has redefined healthcare architecture by creating a space that actively contributes to the healing process.

## Cultural Concept

1. **Tri Angga** is an order in which the cultural and religious belief become the base concept in spatial arrengement with three levels of value. The Balinese expressed them as **utama, madya,** and **nista** (top, middle, and bottom). In human being, Tri Angga would be represented by the **head, body,** and **legs** .

2. The design was developed by involving **local communities** as the main focus of the project, so that it could encourage social interaction, while also providing employment that could impact economy growth through the building process.

3. The **"Connecting People"** concept was developed by creating a **wood deck** that bounds up to three rooms together to create a small social space in between. To encourage greater interaction, a **fireplace** is placed among a larger cluster of the villas, which can be used as a gathering place to relax, socialize, or enjoy the panoramic view of the Mandalika Beach. Every cluster is also connected through a **restaurant** in the center.
