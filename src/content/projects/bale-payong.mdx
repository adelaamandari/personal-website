**Bale Payong**, a temporary shelter for post-disaster evacuation, specifically for earthquake in Lombok and Calamba. "Bale" means house in Lomboknese and "Payong" means umbrella in Tagalog. The main idea of Bale Payong is a temporary house : easy construct shelter that can be deployed as soon as possible when a disaster happen. Just like how umbrella works, the main bamboo structure of Bale Payong can easily expanded depends to the needs and can be combine one another to make bigger structure for communal purposes.

# Project Background

## ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡© Indonesia & ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­ Philippines
Earthquake is a common disaster in Indonesia and Philippines. According to BMKG, Indonesia located in the meeting of three great slab; Australian Slab, Eurasian Slab, and Pacific Slab. That is why tectonic earthquake happen frequently in Indonesia. Earthquakes are probably the biggest threat in terms of natural disasters as they come suddenly and can strike in populus areas.

Lombok, in Nusa Tenggara Barat province Indoneisa has the potential to be shaken by an earthquake because it is located between two earthquake generators from the south and north. These earthquakes are caused by a shallow thrust , at which the Australia and Sunda plates underthrusts the Indonesian volcanic island arcs. Hence, tectonically, Lombok is an active seismic area. Kecamatan Sembalun specifically, categorized as high risk zone for earthquake in East Lombok.

Calamba is a city in Philippines situated near the Laguna de bay (Laguna Lake) which is the largest lake in the philippines and third largest in Southeast Asia. It's location to a bodies of water making it susceptible to floods and soil liquefaction. The Laguna Lake is a catch basin and when it's full, it enhances the flooding in the Metro Manila. It's proximity also to the fault line make the City of Calamba susceptible to ground shaking and earthquake induced landslide.

The city is also located near a mountanious area making it a landslide prone area in case of continuous rain and super typhoon. It's location near and active Taal volcano makes it vulnerable to hazards af volcanic eruption.

## Criteria For Evacuation Area
- For shelter: Min. 3 m2/person
- Access to Essential services and supplies
- Access routes for private and public
- Access ti Essential open space with less building, roadside vegetation

# Idea and Concept
Our concept focuses in the flexibility of the structures which can be transformed into a communal space when these structures are combined.

The modular design is an epitome in case of post-disaster shelters as it's configurations can be changed accordingly as required by the users, be it a shelter enough for a family, or a communal space as schools, kitchen, etc.

Using the reciprocal and tensegrity frames structures, this design will be able to accommodate the three main key points of this design, namely: **flexible, easy to dismantle, and vernacular**. In order to adapt to the climate of the environment as well as for air circulation purposes, the tropical ventilating system of Bahay Kubu and Traditional Houses in Lombok also adopted.
