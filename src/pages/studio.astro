          <p>
            With over a decade of experience in architectural design, I've dedicated my career to creating spaces that seamlessly blend functionality with aesthetic beauty. My journey in architecture began at the Bandung Institute of Technology, where I developed a deep appreciation for sustainable design principles and the importance of cultural context in architecture.
          </p>

          <p>
            My design philosophy centers on three core principles: sustainability, consciousness, and innovation. I believe that great architecture should not only serve its immediate purpose but also contribute positively to the environment and community. This belief has guided my work across various projects, from sustainable rural retreats to modern urban developments.
          </p>

          <p>
            Each project in my portfolio represents a unique challenge and opportunity to create spaces that inspire and endure. Whether designing intimate residential spaces or large-scale commercial projects, I approach each with the same level of dedication to detail and sustainability.
